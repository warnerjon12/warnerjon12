- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Warner. I am currently a student at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/)
  studying Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics. I have worked with
  [Utah Student Robotics](https://github.com/utahrobotics) and I also work as a tutor.
  I find myself working with a lot of sarcastic individuals. Complete coincidence, if you ask me.
- 👀 I’m interested in EVERYTHING. My current interest can vary, but I like to learn things.
  I've worked on different projects involving software design in Java/Python/C/C++
  including embedded programming targeting ARM processors (I like the Teensy 4).
  I've also done basic circuit design and PCB layout,
  with a small amount of 3D modeling. I figure with a 3D printer, a soldering iron, a bunch of parts,
  and some rad skills, I can build machines to do all kinds of cool things. And, occasionally, useful things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to achieve greatness. My current focus is directed towards improving my communication
  and interpersonal skills. But I still seek at all times to learn whatever peaks my interest, as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever sounds interesting. Collaboration allows me to network with other
  cool people that each have something to teach me. I like to work on things that help me connect my subject
  knowledge (math skills/programming/electronics).
